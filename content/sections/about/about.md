As a self taught developer, I value consistency, creativity and attention to detail.

I enjoy creating modern and aesthetically pleasing websites with a preference for intuitive UI and UX. Another passion of mine is the world of e-Commerce and understanding how development, marketing and business play a role in creating a profitable brand.

I'm continously looking to expand my knowledge. Currently, I'm working on creating websites using the Jamstack and integrating a Headless CMS, as well as learn about the backend and databases with Node.js and MongoDB.
